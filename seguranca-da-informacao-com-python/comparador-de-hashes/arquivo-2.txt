That's The Way It Is
The many miles we walked
The many things we learned

The building of a shrine
Only just to burn
May the wind be at your back
Good fortune touch your hand
May the cards lay out a-straight
All from your command

That's the way it is
That's the way it is
That's the way it is
That's the way it is

Blue heron leaves the northern sky
It trusts the journey to new heights
What's the meaning of the scar
If we don't learn how to heal?
Should we ever be apart?
Then how does it feel?

That's the way it is
That's the way it is
That's the way it is
That's the way it is

Shine light into darkness

That's the way it is (I know)
That's the way it is (So many miles to walk)
That's the way it is
(So many things we've got to learn)
That's the way it is
(You're gonna be made to cry)
That's the way it is
(Don't give give up, you don't give it up)
That's the way it is
